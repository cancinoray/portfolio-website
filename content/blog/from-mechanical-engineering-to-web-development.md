I was really happy when I finally received my job offer as a Junior Web Developer from a startup company. Looking back, that moment felt unreal—especially knowing how many struggles and sacrifices it took to get there.

I earned my Mechanical Engineering license right before the lockdown. During that time, I suddenly had plenty of free hours, and I decided to explore programming. I initially committed myself to studying Python, with the goal of becoming a Data Scientist. I enrolled in courses on Coursera—which were free at that time through DOST Caraga—and also joined Project SPARTA by DOST.

Despite all the effort, I eventually realized that data science didn't really click with me. No matter how much I tried to force it, I couldn't see myself enjoying that path long-term.

In 2021, I shifted my focus to Web Development. I started with The Odin Project, then moved on to freeCodeCamp, and eventually invested in Udemy courses. I clearly remember telling myself that time that I was finally taking a risk for my own future. I wasn't from a privileged family, and I was helping support my siblings and parents. People often assumed that being an engineer automatically meant a high salary—but reality was very different.

At that time, I was working the night shift in a manufacturing company. During quiet hours, when there were barely any issues on the floor, I used that time to study coding just to stay awake. Looking back now, those late nights quietly changed the direction of my life.

While self-studying, I also became part of online tech communities. Seeing people who came from engineering backgrounds and successfully transitioned into tech helped boost my confidence. It made the idea of career shifting feel possible—not just a dream. Whenever doubts crept in, the community's encouragement reminded me to keep going, especially during moments when I questioned whether all the time I spent coding would actually lead anywhere.

In April, I made one of the hardest decisions of my life—I resigned from my previous company. At the same time, I was working as a part-time engineering instructor. Using my back pay and limited savings, I calculated that I could survive for about two months without income. I decided to go all in and study web development full-time.

I focused heavily on JavaScript, React, and building projects. I applied to companies almost randomly, hoping that something would eventually work out. The process was exhausting. I went through multiple initial interviews, many of which never gave any feedback. Sometimes I wished companies would just send rejection emails so I could move on instead of waiting in uncertainty.

Eventually, I applied to a position that required two years of web development experience. During the interview, the tech head was honest and told me that my chances were 50–50 because they were really looking for someone with experience. Still, I was able to explain all of his technical questions clearly, and I felt that the discussion went well.

A week later, I was asked to take a technical exam. I struggled badly. I barely slept for two nights trying to finish it, but in the end, I couldn't complete everything. I honestly felt defeated. When the deadline came, I admitted that I wasn't able to finish the exam. I still sent my code anyway.

Unexpectedly, I was told that the company was also looking for an entry-level web developer and asked if I wanted to give it another try. I said yes without hesitation. After an interview with the boss, I finally received the job offer.

I was nervous—but incredibly happy. I had already met the team and was given a list of technologies to study before starting. At that point, everything finally felt worth it.

All the doubts, sleepless nights, financial risks, and sacrifices had finally paid off.

## Advice for Those Who Want to Break Into the Tech Industry

Looking back, there were a few lessons I wish I had fully understood earlier. If you're planning to break into tech, especially from a non-tech or engineering background, here's what I learned:

1. **It's okay if your first tech path doesn't work out.** I started with data science, but it wasn't for me—and that was okay. Trying and pivoting is part of the process.

2. **Consistency matters more than talent.** I wasn't the smartest person in the room. I just kept showing up, even on nights when I was exhausted.

3. **Build projects, not just certificates.** Courses helped, but projects were what truly taught me how things worked and gave me confidence during interviews.

4. **Communities matter more than you think.** Being surrounded by people who were also struggling, learning, and pushing forward helped me stay motivated during low points.

5. **Rejection is part of the journey.** Silence, failed exams, and rejected applications didn't mean I wasn't capable—it just meant I wasn't there yet.

6. **Sometimes, you just need to give yourself a chance.** Even when I felt underqualified, I still applied. One "yes" was all it took.

If you're currently doubting yourself or thinking about shifting careers, I hope my story reminds you that progress is rarely linear, and success often comes right after the moment you feel like giving up.

It wasn't easy—but it was worth it. 🚀
